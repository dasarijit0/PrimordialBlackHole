The only two files we're mainly concerned with here are the ElectronWaveFunction_Class.ipynb and PhotonWaveFunction.ipynb . 

### ElectronWaveFunciton_Class.ipynb 

This class is set up to return solutions for the radial Electron wave functions, both "in" and "up". Currently we're looking at cases where h > mu. 

  
### PhotonWaveFunction_Class.ipynb

This class is set up to return the solutions for photon wave functions, both "in" and "up". 


### module1.py

This python file contains the function r_star_to_r, which returns the corresponding r value for a given r_star value. We are using this as a separate file, and it is being called in both ElectronWaveFunction_Class.iypnb and PhotonWaveFunction_Class.ipynb.
