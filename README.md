The only two files we're mainly concerned with here are the ElectronWaveFunction_Class.ipynb and PhotonWaveFunction.ipynb . 

### ElectronWaveFunciton_Class.ipynb 

So far this class is not giving any errors in terms of the code. The next thing to look at will be whether it's giving the correct F and G radial functions for all the different domains of r_star values. 

  
### PhotonWaveFunction.ipynb

Right now we have a setup for solving the equation 15 from the overleaf doc using the RK-4 method, same as we did in the ElectronWaveFunction_Class.ipynb, for the photon wave functions.
