The only two files we're mainly concerned with here are the Electron_WaveFunction_RK-4.ipynb and ElectronWaveFunction_Class.ipynb. The later one contains the most recent code. It is mostly the code from the Electron_WaveFunction_RK-4.ipynb file, with all of it put within a class for the electron wave functions. 

### ElectronWaveFunciton_Class.ipynb 

So far this class is not giving any errors in terms of the code. The next thing to look at will be whether it's giving the correct F and G radial functions for all the different domains of r_star values.
